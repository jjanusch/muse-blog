Over the last six months, I've retreated from both this blog and my Twitter account. This was unintended, but probably 
unavoidable and I wanted to explain it briefly. In February, my mom was diagnosed with simple cell lung cancer. She was 
given 1-5 years and started chemo immediately. Despite promising early returns, the cancer spread to her throat, uterus,
 liver, spine, and, finally, brain. She passed away June 27th, less than 5 months after diagnosis. I saw her a month 
 earlier when I visited for my niece's first birthday, and was with her for her final three days. Additionally, my dad 
 had a stroke and my grandmother had to have emergency quadruple bypass heart surgery since my mom's diagnosis. 

While entirely unintended, I have had a hard time finding any desire to share things since her diagnosis. It's been a 
rough year, to put it lightly. I have tried to write a few posts (a detailed log of what happened with my mom's death, 
an examination of the DC universe, and some programming-related posts), but none felt of a quality high enough to be 
worth posting. 

I hope to be more active going forward, but that will depend on how I am dealing with the loss of my mom. To be 
perfectly honest, I'm taking it a lot harder than I though I would.
