My name is Josh Janusch and Drift is my personal blog where I discuss interesting things I discover and encounter while 
programming with a lesser focus on sports, film, music, video games, books, and current events.

Since February 2016, I have been the lead developer at VURIA Creative Technology in northern Scottsdale, AZ, where I 
started as a Junior Developer in June 2013. My responsibilities include serving as a primary architect for most large 
system builds (usually built in Laravel or Silex), technical project management, server administration and site hosting 
management, workflow management and improvements, and development of our larger CRM, dashboard, and API builds.
